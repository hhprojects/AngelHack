# Technical Stack
![alt text](https://github.com/hhprojects/AngelHack/blob/master/wwwroot/images/infrastructure.png)
In our web applicaton we used HTML5, CSS, Visual Studio, and GitHub for front-end development, creating a responsive user interface. The back-end is powered by the .NET Framework and C# for robust application logic, with SQL Server handling user data storage.

# Problem
According to a study by NVPC Individual Giving, in 2021 there was a 50% decrease in the median hours volunteered from 2018. One of tthe factors thta might bring about the change could be COVID.

# Our Aim
So our project wish to enhance the low participation rate in the volunteering community.
 
# About Our Application
To counter this problem, we created a platform to increase awareness for volunteerism through a social media webpage, providing a centralized hub for organizaions and retaining volunteers through incentives.

So here a rough outline of our application:
