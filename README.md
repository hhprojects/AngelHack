# Technical Stack
![alt text](https://github.com/hhprojects/AngelHack/blob/master/wwwroot/images/infrastructure.png)
In our web applicaton we used HTML5, CSS, Visual Studio, and GitHub for front-end development, creating a responsive user interface. The back-end is powered by the .NET Framework and C# for robust application logic, with SQL Server handling user data storage.

# Problem
According to a study by NVPC Individual Giving, in 2021 there was a 50% decrease in the median hours volunteered from 2018. One of tthe factors thta might bring about the change could be COVID.

# Our Aim
So our project wish to enhance the low participation rate in the volunteering community.
 
# About Our Application
To counter this problem, we created a platform to increase awareness for volunteerism through a social media webpage, providing a centralized hub for organizaions and retaining volunteers through incentives.

So here a rough outline of our application:

### Community Social Media Page

Individuals and companies able to post their volunteering experience which could help spread awareness to bring more people into our platform.

### Events Page
![alt text](https://github.com/hhprojects/AngelHack/blob/master/wwwroot/images/eventpage.png)
A centralised managament system, where participants could look up for ongoing volunteering event to participate in. Where we also have a interactive map for user to discover more events based on the geolocation.

### Profile Page
![alt text](https://github.com/hhprojects/AngelHack/blob/master/wwwroot/images/profilepage.png)
Personalised profile page for user where it display their commitment hours and also awards what they have achieved, showcasing their achievements, which can helps in future scouting for companies and also for user to boost their portfolio.

# Uniquesness âœ¨

1. Integrate Incentive and Reward System (Reward Page)
2. Interactive Map-Based Event Discovery (Event Page)
3. Social Media Integration and Community Engagement (Community Social Media Page)
4. Event Management for Organizers (Event Page)

# Future Possibilities
1. User Post Creation - Closer to a social media app
2. Personalised Search Algorithm - Recommend more related volunteering event that are more specific to the user based on their previous participation (AI Recommendation System)
3. Automated scheduling system, where the system will notify events for the user to sign up, and automatically add them to a calendar, preventing clashes and sending reminder nearer to the event date
4. Notification System for special subscription for a specific organisation (e.g. when the user subscribed organisation have new event, notification will be send to notifiy the user)
5. Chatting function for multiple user to interact, especially when they sign up for the same event (inviting and sharing with one another)
